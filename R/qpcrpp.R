#' qPCR to Poisson Process
#' 
#' Selected platforms (e.g., Open Array) are real-time platforms. dPCR can be
#' described by Poisson statistics. The function \code{qpcr2pp} takes a step
#' further and interprets the dPCR as a Poisson process if it is analyzed as a
#' "time" based process.
#' 
#' The dPCR Technology breaks fundamentally with the previous concept of
#' nucleic acid quantification. dPCR can be seen as a next generation nucleic
#' acid quantification method based on PCR. The key difference between dPCR and
#' traditional PCR lies in the method of measuring (absolute) nucleic acids
#' amounts. This is possible after ``clonal DNA amplification'' in thousands of
#' small separated partitions (e.g., droplets, nano chambers).  Partitions with
#' no nucleic acid remain negative and the others turn positive. Selected
#' technologies (e.g., OpenArray(R) Real-Time PCR System) monitor amplification
#' reactions in the chambers in real-time. Cq values are calculated from the
#' amplification curves and converted into discrete events by means of positive
#' and negative partitions and the absolute quantification of nucleic acids is
#' done by Poisson statistics.
#' 
#' PCR data derived from a qPCR experiment can be seen as a series of events
#' over time. We define t_i as the time between the first (i - 1)^st and the
#' i^th event. Therefore, the time \eqn{S_n}{S_n} is the sum of all
#' \eqn{t_i}{t_i} from \eqn{i = 1}{i = 1} to \eqn{i = n}{i = n}. This is the
#' time to the n^th event. \eqn{S(t)}{S(t)} is the number of events in \eqn{[0,
#' t]}{[0, t]}. This can be seen as a Poisson process. The Poisson statistics
#' is the central theorem to random processes in digital PCR.
#' 
#' The function \code{qpcr2pp} is used to model random point events in time
#' units (PCR cycles), such as the increase of signal during a qPCR reaction in
#' a single compartment. A Poisson process can be used to model times at which
#' an event occurs in a "system". The \code{qpcr2pp} (quantitative Real-Time
#' PCR to Poisson process) function transforms the qPCR amplification curve
#' data to quantification points (Cq) which are visualized as Poisson process.
#' This functions helps to spot differences between replicate runs of digital
#' PCR experiments. In ideal scenarios the \code{qpcr2pp} plots are highly
#' similar.
#' 
#' This tool might help to spot differences between experiments (e.g.,
#' inhibition of amplification reactions, influence of the chip arrays). The
#' qPCR is unique because the amplification of conventional qPCRs takes place
#' in discrete steps (cycles: 1, 2 ... 45), but the specific Cq values are
#' calculated with continuous outcomes (Cq: 18.2, 25.7, ...). Other
#' amplification methods such as isothermal amplifications are time based and
#' thus better suited for Poisson process.
#' 
#' @param cycles the column containing the cycle data. Defaults to first
#' column.
#' @param process the column containing fluorescence values.
#' @param data a dataframe containing the qPCR data.
#' @param NuEvents NuEvents is "number of expected events" within a time frame
#' (interval).
#' @param delta is the difference "time (cycles) points" e.g., Cycle 18 and 25.
