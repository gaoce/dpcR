\usage{
plot_panel(input, nx_a, ny_a, col = "red", legend = TRUE, half = "none",
	   use_breaks = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{object of the \code{\linkS4class{adpcr}} class. See Details.}

\item{nx_a}{Number of columns in a plate.}

\item{ny_a}{Number of rows in a plate.}

\item{col}{A single color or vector of colors for each level of input.}

\item{legend}{If \code{TRUE}, a built-in legend is added to the plot.}

\item{half}{If \code{left} or \code{right}, every well is represented only
by the adequate half of the rectangle.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to \code{plot} function.}
}
\value{
A list of coordinates of each microfluidic well and an assigned
color.
}
\description{
The \code{plot_panel} function takes objects of the class
\code{\linkS4class{adpcr}} to enable customizable graphical representations
of a chamber-based digital PCR experiments (e.g., Digital Array (R) IFCs
(integrated fluidic circuits) of the BioMark (R) and EP1 (R)).
}
\details{
Currently only objects containing just one column of data (one panel) can be
plotted (see Examples how easily plot multipanel objects). Moreover the
object must contain fluorescence intensities or exact number of molecules or
the positive hits derived from the Cq values for each well. The Cq values
can be obtained by custom made functions (see example in
\code{\link{dpcr_density}})) or the yet to implement "qpcr_analyser function
from the dpcR package.

If the \code{col} argument has length one, a color is assigned for each
interval of the input, with the brightest colors for the lowest values.
