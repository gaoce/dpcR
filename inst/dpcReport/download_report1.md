The analysis, instead of the using dpcReport, may be also conducted using the R environment. In this case check the box "R code used in the report generation". The report will contain ready to use code, which reproduces every step of the analysis performed in dpcReport. Moreover, if you customize any of the input variables, the generated code will be appropriately modified.
