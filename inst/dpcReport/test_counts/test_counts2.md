### The mean number of template molecules per partition

Table below contains the mean number of template molecules per partition (&lambda;) and its confidence intervals. The confidence intervals were adjusted to assure stable 0.95 simultaneous coverage probability, which offers more reliable comparision of technical repeats.

The group is assigned automatically to the run by the statistical test and is represented by a single number (in case of the intermediate groups, a combination of numbers separated by dots). Groups contain experiments which are assessed as similar considering the value of &lambda;.
