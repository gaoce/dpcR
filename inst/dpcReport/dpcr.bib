	abstract = {Digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a promising technique for estimating target DNA copy number. PCR solution is distributed throughout numerous partitions, and following amplification, target DNA copy number is estimated based on the proportion of partitions containing amplified DNA. Here, we identify approaches for obtaining reliable digital PCR data. Single molecule amplification efficiency was significantly improved following fragmentation of total DNA and bias in copy number estimates reduced by analysis of short intact target DNA fragments. Random and independent distribution of target DNA molecules throughout partitions, which is critical to accurate digital PCR measurement, was demonstrated by spatial distribution analysis. The estimated relative uncertainty for target DNA concentration was under 6\% when analyzing five digital panels comprising 765 partitions each, provided the panels contained an average of 212 to 3,365 template molecules. Partition volume was a major component of this uncertainty estimate. These findings can be applied to other digital PCR studies to improve confidence in such measurements.},

	abstract = {Copy Number Variations (CNVs) of regions of the human genome have been associated with multiple diseases. We present an algorithm which is mathematically sound and computationally efficient to accurately analyze CNV in a DNA sample utilizing a nanofluidic device, known as the digital array. This numerical algorithm is utilized to compute copy number variation and the associated statistical confidence interval and is based on results from probability theory and statistics. We also provide formulas which can be used as close approximations.},

  Abstract                 = {Statistical methods for the analysis and design of experiments using digital PCR (dPCR) have received only limited attention and have been misused in many instances. To address this issue and to provide a more general approach to the analysis of dPCR data, we describe a class of statistical models for the analysis and design of experiments that require quantification of nucleic acids. These models are mathematically equivalent to generalized linear models of binomial responses that include a complementary, log?log link function and an offset that is dependent on the dPCR partition volume. These models are both versatile and easy to fit using conventional statistical software. Covariates can be used to specify different sources of variation in nucleic acid concentration, and a model?s parameters can be used to quantify the effects of these covariates. For purposes of illustration, we analyzed dPCR data from different types of experiments, including serial dilution, evaluation of copy number variation, and quantification of gene expression. We also showed how these models can be used to help design dPCR experiments, as in selection of sample sizes needed to achieve desired levels of precision in estimates of nucleic acid concentration or to detect differences in concentration among treatments with prescribed levels of statistical power.},
